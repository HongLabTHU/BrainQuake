## Overview

The **BrainQuake** software has been developed as a comprehensive pre-surgical solution for epilepsy neurosurgeries by providing tools of SEEG electrode registration, surface reconstruction, SEEG ictal and inter-ictal data processing.

## System Requirements

The **BrainQuake** software:

- was developed and tested on Mac OSX, Ubuntu, and Windows;
- works on Python 3.7 or higher;
- has key functions built upon FSL, Freesurfer, Matplotlib, Mayavi, MNE-Python, Nibabel, Numpy, PyQt5, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Socket, and others;
- takes approximately 40 min to run for most datasets.

## Installation Guide

**BrainQuake** server package relies on [FSL](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation) and [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall). You should install them through the instructions on their website. Server codes are not mandatory to be installed. BrainQuake group provides a public server to do the reconstruction and registration works for users. The client package and its Python dependencies can be installed and run with the followingï¼š

    git clone https://github.com/HongLabTHU/BrainQuake.git
    cd BrainQuake
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd BrainQuake
    python client_main.py

**Note!!!** Installation using pip may face a problem of dependency package version conflict! The newest 'mayavi' version has a conflict with the newest 'vtk' package, so in requirement.txt we define the downloading versions to be 'vtk==8.1.2' and 'mayavi==4.6.2'. If you have installed a later version of mayavi or vtk before, please notice the version changing issue. For now, matplotlib version should be fixed to 3.4.3.

We **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** a one-stop installation option that you use anaconda to create a virtual environment for all those packages and dependencies. After installing [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads), run the following: (python>=3.6 will all be fine.)

    conda create -n bq_env -c conda-forge python=3.7 numpy scipy matplotlib=3.4.3 nb_conda vtk mayavi=4.6.2 mne nibabel scikit-learn
    
With this conda virtual environment (venv) 'bq_env' created, BrainQuake main window can pop up by running:

    conda activate bq_env
    cd <directory>/BrainQuake/BrainQuake
    python client_main.py
